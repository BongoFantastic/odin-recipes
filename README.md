# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project assignment! I'll use the HTML code info that TOP has tought me
to build a little recipe page. Focus on accessibility using "strong" and "em" with
proper headings to break up the page in a way that browsers can read easily.

POST
Austere pages with just text and very little thought to structure and visuals.
I feel like I did a lot of moving around with the arrow keys. Surely the lists, and
HTML tags in general, can be surfed through a bit more quickly than I have been.
Still, a healthy of copy and pasting made the process go faster.
I tried to find as many points as possible to break and push to git. I'm generally
pleased with how many commits I have with one huge commit that could probably be
broken into a few.
Feel good coding with HTML though.
